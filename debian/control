Description: Minos core settings
 This package provides the minimal settings which gives to minos its identity.
 It's intend to be installed in all environments, even on those where X is not
 running.
 .
 Settings are organized in modules which can be enabled/disabled by system
 administrators.
 .
 If a $HOME/.minos/not_override file exists modules will not alter files on
 that user directory.
 .
 Run $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure minos-core-settings to enable/disable options
 (enabled all by default).
